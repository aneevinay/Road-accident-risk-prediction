# Road Accident Risk Prediction 🚗💥



### 📘 Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of road accidents using various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost.

After evaluating multiple models, the final model was developed using XGBoost, with hyperparameter tuning performed through RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance.
